## About
This is the mobile-friendly version of my [portfolio site](https://matt.westwick.dev). Unfortunately this site does allow user input / gameplay (yet), but it does implement touchscreen controls for navigation.

## License
This code is 100% free (as in beer) to use! See the [license](./LICENSE.md).

The only request I make is that if I inspired your project, that you let me know about it so I can check it out!
